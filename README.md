A Mac based application that allows users to code with their voice

This app is designed to fill a huge hole in the mac market - a free high quality application that allows people to code with their voice and doesn't require the use of expensive (and buggy) programs like Dragon.

This relies on off the shelf speech recognition products such as Apple speech, or Sphinx.

This is a NEW project so if you suffer from repetetive stress injuries (RSI's) like me and don't want to get ripped off paying $300 to $600 for a voice coding application, then you are welcome here.
